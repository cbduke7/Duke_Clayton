			<p>I like to to play volleyball both beach and indoor. I have played indoor

			blocker. I played on the schools beach team for the past two years. This year 
			we lost in the finals. I like playing soccer because it is my best sport. I have 
			been playing since I was five years old. This year I have enjoyed going to concerts
			and seeing djs perform. I have now been to eight shows. I like hanging out with my 
			friends and chilling at home.</p>
