		The language of html revolves around tags. A tag looks like this <strong><Tags></strong>. 
		The first tag you create on a website declares a doctype. Ex:!doctype html.  
		Most tags have opening and closings of tags. That would look like this Tags
		/Tags. To close a tag you put a forward slash in front. Everything in a web
		object is contained within the opening and closing tags. Everything outside the
		tags belongs to another object. Some tags are singular and donâ€™t have an opening
		and closing, they look like this tag/.  To create a basic HTML frame you do this
		html and then close it below with /html everything inside is your website.

		The first type of tag I will talk about is the head tag. The head of a site includes 
		information for the browser. The information in the head is not seen by the user of 
		the site. It includes keywords for search engines, the title of the website, browser 
		information etc. The body tag of the site includes all of the actual site content, 
		including paragraphs,images, audio, animations, backgrounds, and so on. A header tag, 
		known as <strong>h1</strong> through <strong>h6</strong> in html, is a system of section titles where the lowest number 
		has the greatest font size and the highest has lowest font size.

	<h3><a name = "Links and Images"></a>Links and Images</h3>
		<p>
		To add images to a website using html, you use the image tag, known as <strong>img</strong> in html.
		How you do this is by saving the image in the same folder as the html site. Then you 
		declare it as a source, known as <strong>src</strong> in html. To do this you type the name of the image
		in quotation marks. To close a img tag you only put a greater than sign with no forward 
		slash. To adjust the size of an image, you only need to adjust the height attribute. If 
		you are keeping the aspect ratio (proportions / shape) of the image the same. You can also
		distort the image by changing around the height and width. You add a link with the anchor 
		tag, known as just <strong>a</strong> in html.  The anchor tag allows us to link to other sites, other pages
		on our own site, or even specific places in a particular page.  To do this first you put the
		anchor tag then inside it and then you declare it a href by putting the link of the site in
		quotation. Then close that part with a greater than sign and then you name the link.
		Lastly you close it with a forward slashed anchor tag. You can add links to separate 
		parts of pages by naming your different sections and creating links to them. Use tool
		tips to give a description of a link. To do this you declare your description of the 
		link to title after the link in quotation marks.

	<h3><a name = "Paragraph Formatting"></a>Paragraph Formatting</h3>
		<p>
		HTML is not sensitive to white space, meaning it doesn't translate the spaces, tabs, and return
		characters onto the visible body elements of your site. Your browser looks at all of your text
		in one long line of code. The paragrapg tag known as, <strong>p</strong> in html, allows you to tell the browser
		explicitly which text in a web document you want to put into paragraph form. You may not want
		to add a separate set of tags for each separate paragraph. HTML has a tag for adding a single 
		space, called a line break. Using a line break tag, known as <strong>br</strong>, will allow you to add a single 
		space inside of a paragraph tag. This is a singular tag. The horizontal rule tag, known as <strong>hr</strong> in 
		html, adds a horizontal line that acts as a separator. This is a singular tag. To make text bold 
		you use the strong tag, known as <strong>strong</strong> in html, which puts the enclosed text in bold. The 
		emphasize tag, known as <strong>em</strong> in html, italicizes the text enclosed with in it.
