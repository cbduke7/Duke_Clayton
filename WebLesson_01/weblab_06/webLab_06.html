		<p>Volleyball and soccer are my life.</p>
		<p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net.</p>
		<p>Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.</p>
		<p> But simply, play proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court.</p>
