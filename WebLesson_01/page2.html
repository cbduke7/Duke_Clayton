		Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball with the foot to score a goal. 
		Unqualified, the word football is understood to refer to whichever form of football 
		is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears.

		The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. 
		The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as "ἐπίσκυρος" (Episkyros)[11][12] 
		or "φαινίνδα" (phaininda),[13] which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later 
		referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD). These games appear to have 
		resembled rugby football.[14][15][16][17][18] The Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC) describes the case of a 
		man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already 
		knew the air-filled ball, the follis.[19][20] Episkyros is recognised as an early form of football by FIFA.[21]

		The earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the 
		ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, 
		a poet and teacher in Aberdeen, Scotland.[60] Nevertheless, the original text does not 
		state whether the allusion to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('Repercute pilam') was 
		in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as 
		was usual at this time)[61]
